# MOC-for-Supersonic-Nozzle
Finds contour of a supersonic nozzle by employing Method of Characteristics.

This program generates contour for a minimum length nozzle. The flow expands through sharp corner at throat. The input can be of two types:

[1] You have chamber properties. Then specify T_c, P_c, g, FT, m_dot, D, ALT and n.

[2] If you already have Me, then only Me, g, D and n are required.

Also you can export nozzle contour points as x,y,z format in a .csv file.
